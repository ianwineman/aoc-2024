Another very minimal `diff` between the two parts, namely:
```
‚ùØ diff julia/d8p1.jl julia/d8p2.jl 
46c46
<         pair_antinodes = [p1.-slope,p2.+slope]
---
>         pair_antinodes = [p1.+(i,i).*slope for i=-max(input_dims[1],input_dims[2]):max(input_dims[1],input_dims[2])]
```
The change accounts for adding *antinodes* along all the positions on the given line between two atennas, as opposed to a single pair as in part 1.
