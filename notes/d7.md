I should have started taking notes earlier, but *the second-best time is now*.

There is very minimal `diff` between `d7p1.jl` and `d7p2.jl`, namely:
```
‚ùØ diff julia/d7p1.jl julia/d7p2.jl
12c12
<     masks = collect(Iterators.product([0:1 for i=1:(length(equation[2])-1)]...))
---
>     masks = collect(Iterators.product([0:2 for i=1:(length(equation[2])-1)]...))
16c16
<             Bool(m[i]) ? acum*=equation[2][i+1] : acum+=equation[2][i+1]
---
>             (m[i] == 0) ? acum*=equation[2][i+1] : (m[i] == 1) ? acum+=equation[2][i+1] : acum = parse(Int64,join([string(acum),string(equation[2][i+1])],""))
```
The first change from `0:1` to `0:2` represents the introduction of a third operation: `||`. The second change introduces nested ternaries to account for the third operation. This is certainly more readable as a `if elseif` conditional (see commit [`51dbe98`](https://github.com/ianwineman/aoc-2024/commit/51dbe98923d50500a1b4216a0ac68623ce52befe)), but structuring it as two nested ternaries allows for a very similar structure between parts 1 & 2.
