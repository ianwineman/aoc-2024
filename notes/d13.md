In part 1 we exploit the fact that each machine is a combination of two linear diophantine equations. The `gcdx(a,b)` function computes the BÃ©zout coefficients of `a` and `b` which can be used to find an initial solution to each diophantine equation, from which additional solutions can be generated from.

The approach in part 1 (at least as I could see it) is too slow for part 2, so we simply solve it as a 2d system of linear equations, which also provides a simpler solutoin for part 1 in hindsight.
